   
1)   IN THIS PROGRAM FIRST I HAVE IMPLEMENTED PUSH AND POP FUNCTION.
     IF WE SELECT THE FIRST OPTION i.e PUSH THEN IF NEXT ELEMENT(n) IS ONLY 1 MORE THEN
     PREVIOUS ELEMENT(S) IT MEANS if(n==s+1) THEN ONLY IT WILL PUSH THE ELEMENT OTHERWISE        THROWS ERROR.


               
2)   FOR THE PATTERN CHECK : SUPPOSE OUR PATTERN IS 4321098765
     NOW AFTER ENTERING PATTERN USING LOOP for(j=0;j<= s[0]-'0' ;j++) IT WILL EXECUTED 5         TIMES AND THEN 0 TO 4 ELEMENT WILL BE PUSHED.AND 4 TO 0 WILL BE POPED.
 
     NOW OUR ELEMENT 4 IS LESS THEN NEXT ELEMENT IS ARRAY ie. 9. so we will execute the          loop (9-4)=5 times. THEN SAME PROCESS WILL GET REPEATED. 5 TO 9 WILL GET PUSHED AND 9       TO 5 WILL GET POPED. THUS IN THIS WAY IT WILL VALIDATE THE PATTERN AND DISPLAYS             WHETHER IT IS VALID OR NOT.
