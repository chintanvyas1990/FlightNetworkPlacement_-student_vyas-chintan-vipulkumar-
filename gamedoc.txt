    1) IN THIS PROGRAM I HAVE CREATED 1 ARRAY NAMED KID.WE WILL ENTER THE NUMBER OF KIDS.
     
    2)INITIALLY ALL THE KIDS ARE LIVE SO I HAVE ASSIGNED 1 TO ALL KIDS. i.e kid[i]=1.

    3) AFTER THAT WE WILL ENTER THE COUNT n WHICH IS LESS THAN m(NO OF KIDS).

    4) THEN n NUMBERED KID WILL GET ELIMINATED SO kid[i]=0.

    5) NOW WE HAVE TO START CONUT FROM n+1 AND STUDENTS ARE SITTING IN CIRCLE SO IN ORDER
 
       TO ELIMINATE NEXT KID I HAVE TAKEN 1 COUNTER i.e co .  IF n+1th KID IS ALREADY DEAD       
       THEN IT WILL NOT INCREMENT CO(COUNT) BUT IT WILL INCREMENT POSITION OF KID UNTILL IT 
 
       FIND  NEXT LIVE KID AND WHEN IT FIND KID AT N POSTION IT WILL ELIMINATE IT AND IF
 
       KID POSITION IS LAST THEN IT WILL CONTINUE THE COUNT FROM 1ST KID. THIS PROCESS 

       CONTINUES UNTILL THERE IS ONLY 1 KID LEFT.
        

     6) THUS IT WILL FIND WINNER.
